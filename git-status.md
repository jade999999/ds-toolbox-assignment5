Definition: git status

The git status command in Git provides a detailed summary of the current state of the working directory and the staging area. It helps developers understand what changes have been made, what changes are staged for the next commit, and which files are not being tracked by Git. 

If you are using JupyterLab and want to access the same information provided by the git status command, you can utilize the integrated Git extension available in JupyterLab. Alternative way is using a Terminal within JupyterLab.
